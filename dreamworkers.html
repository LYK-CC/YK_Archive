        <p>It was a quiet Friday afternoon, I was only an 8th grader. Just before the end of the school day. The
          second-to-last period on our schedule was homeroom, which was usually a time for announcements or class
          bonding.
        </p>

        <p>But that day, my team and I were in a hurry. We had a tight deadline for our <a
            href="index.html#essays">SJMMA</a>
          math modeling
          competition, a
          afterschool club which I was part of (we usually had our last period on Friday for club activities) and we
          were
          deep into building our final presentation slides. Instead of staying in class, we quietly slipped away to
          one of
          the meeting rooms to keep working.</p>

        <p>I remember being completely absorbed in the details of PowerPoint, adjusting equations, reordering
          graphs, and
          debating visual effects. That’s when our homeroom teacher, who was also my physics instructor, came
          looking for
          me. He asked me to return to the classroom because there was a group of students there giving a
          presentation.
          They were, apparently, from another club and were promoting a charity event.</p>

        <div class="my-4 p-4 rounded shadow-sm border" style="background-color: rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.05);">
          <p class="mb-2">
            The project we were working on, which you can still view on
            <a href="https://gitlab.com/LYK-CC/SJMMA21526198" target="_blank"
              class="fw-semibold text-primary">GitLab</a>.
          </p>
        </div>


        <p>When I walked back in, I saw a few unfamiliar faces standing at the front of the class. They introduced
          themselves as organizers of a nonprofit initiative and explained that they were planning a charity concert
          for
          children with autism. The goal was to raise awareness and donate all the proceeds to a special school for
          autistic children.</p>

        <img src="assets/dreamworkers/xingqiao.jpg" alt="Organization Logo"
          style="max-width: 200px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">


        <p>I wasn’t sure what to think. I listened passively, unsure if I was just being polite or
          curious. But
          then something in their presentation caught my attention. They spoke about the children as “gifts from the
          stars”, which is a phrase that stuck with me. These were kids who, for reasons no one could fully explain,
          had
          fallen behind in the traditional systems of learning and growth. The down syndrome kids. The speakers
          emphasized
          how important it was for society to not just acknowledge these children, but to stand with them, support
          them,
          and understand them.</p>

        <p>I knew deep down that I wasn’t the ideal candidate for a volunteer role like this. I wasn’t someone who
          naturally gravitated toward service or social projects. But something about this one pulled me in. Maybe
          it was
          the way they spoke. Maybe it was the timing. Or maybe it was simply that I’ve always been someone who gets
          curious about everything.</p>

        <p>I mentioned my WeChat account before, TianceSec (refer to the next webpage for my story). It was part of
          my
          journey on cybersecurity education. I showed them some of the materials, and to my surprise, they were
          genuinely
          impressed. The conversation flowed effortlessly after that. We shared ideas, swapped stories, and they
          invited
          me to join them. I was offered a role on the backend team, helping with event planning and designing the
          presentation slides that would be used during the concert.</p>

        <p>A few weeks later, I went with them on a visit to the charity’s base. It was my first real-world exposure
          to
          this kind of work. We toured the facility, sat through a talk given by the program’s director, and learned
          about
          how the organization functioned day to day. I heard stories about the children, about their families,
          their
          challenges, and their victories. We were also given guidelines on how to interact with the kids, how to be
          respectful, how to listen, and how to understand their world without trying to change it.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t until a casual dinner with a few members of the team that I learned something I hadn’t known
          before.
          The person who had founded the project was actually an alumna from our own school, SESID, which was about
          four
          years ahead of me.</p>

        <p>Our school had a somewhat unusual grade structure at the time. There were students just one year above
          us, but
          technically, that group was considered the first official graduating class of the school. The two earlier
          cohorts were more like “trial years,” without a complete graduation system. So, in a way, she was part of
          the
          school’s first real generation of middle school alumni.</p>

        <p>They had rented a small venue near Tianzifang in Shanghai. It was called the Tianzifang Art Center. On
          the day
          of the event, there were about 80 to 100 people in attendance, and each ticket was priced at around 50
          RMB.</p>

        <!-- 音乐会海报 -->
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

            style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
        </div>


        <p>Frankly, as the concert day approached, I wasn’t really focused on the event itself. I wasn’t exactly
          performing well in terms of contributing to the planning or actively helping with the team’s mission. I
          wasn’t
          disengaged, but I wasn’t really showing up either.</p>

        <p>During the concert, I remember sitting there thinking about one thing: <strong>sustainability</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Back when we were being trained at the charity base, one of the teachers had talked to us about the
          importance
          of consistency. For children on the autism spectrum, it takes a long time to become comfortable with a
          volunteer. Many of them are fearful of unfamiliar faces, and building trust takes weeks, even months.
          That’s why
          we were asked, at the time, whether we were willing to commit to long-term service.</p>

        <p>We all raised our hands and took a sort of symbolic pledge. I went along with it too, though deep down I
          knew I
          probably wouldn’t have that kind of commitment. I wasn’t sure how long my enthusiasm would last, and
          honestly, I
          didn’t love volunteer work enough to pretend otherwise. I’m guessing I wasn’t the only one who felt that
          way
          during the pledge.</p>

        <p>The concert lasted for about an afternoon. When it was over, everyone gradually left, and that was it.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a detailed summary, refer to the article published on WeChat:
          <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E51Ks1it_PZNAz4Ij-Iqxg" target="_blank">First Event Summary</a>.
        </p>


        <p>
          Not long after, I had a feeling I would be removed from the team. I hadn’t done enough to stay. But even if I
          hadn’t been removed, I started to wonder whether the organization itself was sustainable. Moreover, is that
          really
          what the kids want, or is it just showtime for volunteers trying to enhance their college applications?
        </p>



        <p>
          Even if it came at the cost of how impressive an individual event looked, maybe sustainability was more
          important in the long run. Those children would much rather have ongoing companionship than dazzling one-time
          experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          A small organization, no matter how well-intentioned,
          cannot create
          real, lasting impact on its own. Yes, might be some minimal impact, through long-term commitment,
          institutional support, and genuine
          persistence
          that real change becomes possible. One-off efforts can raise awareness, yes, but, for the children, it’s not
          the awareness
          that matters. It’s the consistency. The presence. The people who come back, again and again.

        </p>

        <p>Even if it meant that individual events weren’t flashy or impressive, maybe what really mattered was staying
          power. Maybe consistency was more important than spectacle. Because if you asked the kids, they would probably
          rather have someone who keeps showing up than someone who puts on a one-time show and never comes back.

          But then again, even consistency has its limits. Even if the volunteers kept showing up every year, even if
          they cared deeply and kept trying, how much real impact could they make? Each ticket was priced at only 50
          RMB. At most, there were maybe one hundred people in the audience. That meant each concert raised about five
          thousand RMB (around 700 USD). And there was only one concert each year.

          How many times would they have to do this to reach just ten thousand? And more importantly, how much
          difference could that money actually make for a school that needed steady support?

          It started to feel like all that energy, all those hours from so many volunteers, were being poured into just
          one small event. It was touching, yes, but it was not efficient. It was not something that could grow. No
          matter how sincere the effort, the scale was too limited to truly make a difference.</p>

        <p>So the actual question that came up to my mind was:</p>

        <div class="text-center my-5">
          <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: #0dcaf0; font-style: italic;">Can I build something thats scalable?
